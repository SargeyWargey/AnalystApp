# Cross-Platform Productivity App Development Plan

## Overview
Building a cross-platform productivity app with MarkDown conversion and integrated terminal features for team use. The app will run on both Windows and Mac with a consistent interface.

## Technical Approach
**Recommended Strategy**: Develop simultaneously for both platforms using Electron + React for maximum compatibility and shared codebase efficiency.

---

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Architecture
- [x] Choose cross-platform framework (Electron with React/Vue or Tauri with React)
- [x] Set up development environment for both Windows and Mac
- [x] Initialize project structure with proper folder organization
- [x] Set up build pipeline for cross-platform compilation
- [x] Configure version control and development workflow

## Phase 2: Core Application Foundation
- [x] Create main application window and basic layout
- [x] Implement left sidebar with icon navigation system
- [x] Set up routing/state management for different tool modes
- [x] Create responsive layout that adapts to window resizing
- [x] Implement basic theming and styling framework

## Phase 3: MarkDown Conversion Tool (First Feature)
- [x] Integrate MarkItDown Python library via subprocess or API
- [x] Create drag-and-drop file import area in main content area
- [x] Implement file import dialog as alternative to drag-drop
- [x] Build destination folder management on right side
- [x] Add/remove destination folder functionality
- [x] Implement folder selection validation
- [x] Create convert button with proper state management (disabled until destination set)
- [x] Build conversion progress indicator and status feedback
- [x] Handle conversion errors and user notifications
- [x] Test with various file types (PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc.)

## Phase 4: Integrated Terminal Tool (Second Feature)
- [ ] Create file explorer component for left half of main area
- [ ] Implement folder tree navigation with file listings
- [ ] Build integrated terminal component for right half
- [ ] Set up terminal process spawning in selected directory
- [ ] Implement "Start Terminal" button with directory context
- [ ] Add terminal session management (multiple tabs/sessions)
- [ ] Configure terminal for Claude Code and other CLI tools
- [ ] Handle terminal input/output and process management

## Phase 5: Application Polish & Testing
- [ ] Implement comprehensive error handling across all features
- [ ] Add user preferences and settings storage
- [ ] Create application menus and keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Implement file association and system integration
- [ ] Add application icons and branding
- [ ] Comprehensive testing on both Windows and Mac
- [ ] Performance optimization and memory management
- [ ] User documentation and help system

## Phase 6: Packaging & Distribution
- [ ] Set up code signing for both platforms
- [ ] Create Windows installer (MSI/NSIS)
- [ ] Create Mac application bundle and DMG
- [ ] Set up automated build and release pipeline
- [ ] Test installation and uninstallation processes
- [ ] Prepare distribution channels (internal deployment)

## Technical Recommendations

### Framework Choice
- **Primary Recommendation**: Electron with React
  - Mature ecosystem with extensive cross-platform support
  - Large community and documentation
  - Easy integration with Node.js backend processes
  - Consistent UI across platforms

### Key Integrations
- **MarkItDown Integration**: Python subprocess with JSON communication
- **Terminal Emulation**: node-pty for cross-platform terminal support
- **File System Operations**: Native Node.js fs modules with proper permissions
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit or Zustand for complex application state
- **UI Framework**: Material-UI or Ant Design for consistent styling

### Supported File Types (via MarkItDown)
- PDF documents
- Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint)
- Images (with OCR capabilities)
- HTML files
- Text-based formats (CSV, JSON, XML)
- ZIP archives
- Audio files (with transcription)
- EPub documents
- YouTube URLs

## Development Notes
- Start with Phase 1 and work sequentially through each phase
- Test on both Windows and Mac at each major milestone
- Each checkbox represents a testable, completable task
- Regular commits after completing each checkbox item
- User testing after Phase 3 and Phase 4 completion

**Project Start Date**: 2025-09-17  
**Target Completion**: TBD based on development pace  
**Primary Developer**: Claude Code Assistant + Team
